        <ul className="list-unstyled">
          <li className="">
            The airline tickets available through the Website are subject to the
            terms & conditions of the concerned airline, including but not
            limited to cancellation and refund policies.
          </li>
          <li>
            ReservationKart merely acts as a facilitator to enable the User to
            book a flight ticket. The contract of service for utilization of the
            flight is always between the User and the concerned airline.
          </li>
          <li>
            Airlines retain the right to reschedule flight times, route, change
            or cancel flights or itineraries independent of and without prior
            intimation to ReservationKart. As a facilitator, ReservationKart has
            no control or authority over the logistics of the airlines and
            therefore is not liable for any loss, direct or incidental, that a
            User may incur due to such change or cancellation of a flight.
          </li>
          <li>
            Different tickets on the same airline may carry different
            restrictions or include different services and price.
          </li>
          <li>
            The baggage allowance on given fare is as per the terms decided by
            the airline, and ReservationKart has no role to play in the same.
            Some of the fares shown in the booking flow are “hand baggage fares”
            which do not entitle the User for free check-in baggage and
            therefore the User will be required to pay separately for check-in
            baggage. The prices for adding check-in baggage to a booking may
            vary from airline to airline. The User is advised to contact the
            airlines for detailed costs.

        <h2 className="sub-heading">CODE SHARE</h2>
        <ul className="list-unstyled">
          <li>
            Some airlines enter into "code share" agreements with other
            Airlines. This means that on certain routes, the airline carrier
            selling or marketing the flight ticker does not fly its own aircraft
            to that destination. Instead, it contracts or partners with another
            airline to fly to that destination. The partner airline is listed as
            "operated by" in the booking flow.
          </li>
          <li>
            If your flight is a code share, it will be disclosed to you in the
            booking process and prior to payment.
          </li>
          <li>
            ReservationKart will disclose any such code-share arrangements to
            the User, only when the ticketing airline discloses it to
            ReservationKart in the first place.

        <h2 className="sub-heading">PRICING</h2>
        <ul className="list-unstyled">
          <li>
            The total price displayed on the Website on the payment page usually
            includes base fare, applicable government taxes and convenience fee.
            Users are required to pay the entire amount prior to the
            confirmation of their booking(s). In the event the User does not pay
            the entire amount, ReservationKart reserves its right to cancel the
            booking. User agrees to pay all statutory taxes, surcharges and
            fees, as applicable on the date of travel.
          </li>
          <li>
            To avail infant fares, the age of the child must be under 24 months
            throughout the entire itinerary. This includes both onward and
            return journeys. If the infant is 24 months or above on the return
            journey, User will be required to make a separate booking using a
            child fare. Any infants or children must be accompanied by an adult
            as per the terms of the airlines.

            carrying valid travel documents, ReservationKart shall in no way be
            held liable.
          </li>
          <li>
            User understands that the information (if any) provided by
            ReservationKart regarding the travel documents is only advisory in
            nature and can’t be considered conclusive. The User shall ensure

            In the event User does not embark on the onward journey, the entire
            PNR pertaining to that booking shall be automatically cancelled by
            the airline. In such a scenario ReservationKart has no control in
            the said process nor will be obligated to provide alternate bookings
            to the User. The cancellation penalty in such an event shall be as

          <li>
            The User shall be obligated to pay applicable charges in the event
            of any alteration or modification to an existing booking. However,

            Refunds will be processed as per the airline fare rules and
            cancellation policy. Such refunds shall be subject to
            ReservationKart receiving the same from the airlines. However, the
            convenience fee paid to ReservationKart paid at the time of booking
            is a non-refundable fee.
          </li>
          <li>
            All cancellations made directly with the airline need to be
            intimated to ReservationKart, in order to initiate the process of
            refund. The processing time for refunds may vary depending on the
            mode of payment, bank etc. The refund shall be processed after
            deducting the ReservationKart service fee which is independent of
            the convenience fee as mentioned above.
          </li>
          <li>
            The refund will be credited to the same account from which the
            payment was made. For example, if the User used a credit card,
            ReservationKart will make an appropriate charge reversal to the same
            credit card; likewise, if the User used a debit card, ReservatinKart
            will credit the money to the same debit card.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the event of cancellation and refund of partially utilized
            tickets, upfront discount and promo code discount availed at the
